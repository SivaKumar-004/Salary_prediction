# Salary Prediction & Streamlit App

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing salary data to uncover insights based on education level, job role, and years of experience. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated to predict salaries with optimal accuracy. The final model is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit web application, allowing users to interactively estimate salaries based on input parameters.

## Features

- Data analysis and visualization of salary trends
- Regression models to predict salary
- Model performance comparison
- Interactive salary prediction app using Streamlit
